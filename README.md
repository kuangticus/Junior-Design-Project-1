# Junior-Design-Project-1

The ECE 341 Junior design folder holds the prodject files and the code for a Persistence of Vision wand (POV).

I have included the Ardunio firmware that is used to run the POV and bill of materials so that the people can recreate this if they would like to in the future, also to see how much is costed for me to make this.
